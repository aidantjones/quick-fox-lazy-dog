      <h3>Philosophy</h3>

      <p>If you ever took a typing class, you might remember some of the exercises. Much of them were gibberish or random words; some were intelligible but unnatural. This text from Uncanny Valley attempts to create a realistic typing scenario while still testing the skills learned in a particular lesson.</p>

      <p>I noticed this offputting text and thought it would render endearing poetry. The tradition of found poetry and <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-artificial-intelligence-poetry">AI's recent foray into poetic authorship</a> informed the idea for this project.</p>

      <p>I wrote a program that randomly generates poetry from strings gathered from Mark's <a href="https://archive.org/details/touchtypingmades00mark/page/n8"><em>Touch Typing Made Simple</em></a> as well as Lloyd, Winger, Johnson, Morrison, and Hall's
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/greggkeyboarding0000unse"><em>Gregg Keyboarding and Personal Application</em></a>, published in 1985 and 1987, respectively. Any set of strings could be used instead, however, providing opportunities to create diverse poetry.</p>

      <p>The results are humorous but also thought-provoking. Typing exercises are not intended for use outside of touch typing practice. De-contextualizing them highlights how technology can change what we type and, ultimately, create.</p>

      <p>The source material also comes out of the home computer boom. The layperson's interest in computing swelled during the eighties. <em>Quick Fox, Lazy Dog</em> is also an homage to that trailblazing era.</p>

      <h3 id="process">Process</h3>
      <p>If one were to make poetry out of <em>any</em> word in a typing book, it wouldn't be much of a restriction. I sourced strings from the exercises in <span style="font-family: 'Anonymous Pro'; font-weight: bold;">monotype</span> font within Mark's book. The poems adhere to the following rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I recorded strings exactly as is except for ending periods</li>
        <li>I took artistic license in editing the beginnings and endings of strings. The program does not put a string in the middle of another, like poetry fridge magnets</li>
        <li>Each string is a new line</li>
        <li>Strings must contain at least two words</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These guidelines avoid mixing and matching of individual words to preserve the original tone.</p>

      <h3>Conceptualization</h3>

      <p>Because I'm a big ol' nerd, I recently purchased an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard">Apple Extended Keyboard II</a>. I started doing typing exercises to become acquainted with it (it's beautiful) which reminded me of this hidden poetry.</p>

      <p>I've also started learning basic front-end web development, including Javascript. I realized Javascript would be the perfect language to write this poetry generator in. The rest is history.</p>
