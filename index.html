    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>If you ever took a typing class, you might remember some of the exercises. Much of them were gibberish or random words while some were intelligible but unnatural. This text from Uncanny Valley is an attempt to create a realistic typing
      scenario while still testing the skills learned in a particular lesson.</p>

    <p>I noticed this weird text and thought I could compile it into strange poetry. The tradition of found poetry and <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-artificial-intelligence-poetry">AI's recent foray into poetic authorship</a>
      informed the idea for this project.</p>

    <p>My goal is to create a simple program that randomly generates poetry from strings gathered from Mark's <em>Touch Typing Made Simple</em>, published in 1985.</p>

    <p>I intend the results to be humorous at times. But this niche found poetry also comments on the ways in which the computational world informs how we interpret our world through our writing. The strings I pulled from this book were not intended for outside the context of testing one's touch typing. But these exercises were created to allow an emerging demographic to use the home computer. De-contextualizing these exercises brings attention to this continuing massive social change.</p>

    <p>The source material also comes out of the home computer boom. The eighties saw the rise of the layperson's interest in computing and, consequentially, typing. Thus, this project is also an homage to that trailblazing era of computing.</p>

    <p>If one were to make poetry out of <em>any</em> word in a typing book, it wouldn't be much of a restriction. I sourced strings from the exercises in monotype font within Mark's book. The poems adhere to the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I recorded strings exactly as is except for ending periods</li>
      <li>I took artistic license in editing the beginnings and endings of strings. The program does not put a string in the middle of another, like poetry fridge magnets</li>
      <li>Each string is a new line</li>
      <li>Strings must contain at least two words</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These guidelines avoid mixing and matching of individual words to preserve the original tone.</p>

    <h2>Conceptualization</h2>
    <p>Because I'm a big ol' nerd, I recently purchased an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard">Apple Extended Keyboard II</a>. I started doing typing exercises to become acquainted with it (it's beautiful) which reminded of this hidden poetry.</p>
    <p>I've also started to learn basic front-end web development languages, including Javascript. It occurred to me that Javascript would be the perfect language to write this poetry generator in. The rest is history.</p>
